Developed for Eco (http://www.strangeloopgames.com/eco/), a ecosystem simulation multiplayer survival game.

### What I worked on:

I implemented: 
* A Unity modding API capable of working on any platform (including mobile!)
* Networking systems, including a content delivery system for syncing client files.
* Various gameplay systems, with a note towards making them easy and fun to mod.

Eco is an edutainment game focused on placing many players into a completely simulated, networked world.  Everything is destructible and players must build technology, form governments, and make ethical desicision in order to thwart an incoming natural disaster.
