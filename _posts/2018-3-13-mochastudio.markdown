### What I worked on:

Large scale, user-friendly, and feature heavy game engine.
Mocha Engine supports 2D and 3D modes, advanced physics, sound modulation, complete asset pipeline, and more.
Mocha Engine runs with a robust game editor that can be used to produce game logic and maps quickly and easily. 

Here's some major features I implemented personally:
* Scene Editor
* Core Engine Architecture
* Bug Tracking / User Interfacing
* Implementation and Maintenance of the Scripting Languages (AngelScript, then C#)
* Property inspection
* Asset management
* Performance visualization tools
* User-friendly input binding
* In-built script editor
* Sprite Animation editor. 

Later features added include:

* De-Synchronous Core - All engine systems (Physics, GFX, etc.) run in total parallel with no contention using a fiber based job scheduler and unique frame processing method.
* Remote Rendering - engine can be seperated from the graphics renderer, allowing the output to be displayed across a network or in a different environment, such as a browser.
* Multi-User Scene Editing - multiple people may work over a network on the same scene in the game editor without conflicts.
