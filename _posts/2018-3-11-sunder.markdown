### Game Description:

Sunder uses special color filtering glasses to split the images you see into two "worlds" - effectively hiding information right in front of the players' eyes.
Sunder is a multiplayer puzzle platformer in which two players cooperate to solve puzzles on the same screen while in separate worlds. This is achieved by giving each player red & blue filtering glasses such that they may only see one color at a time. Verbal Communication is key.
